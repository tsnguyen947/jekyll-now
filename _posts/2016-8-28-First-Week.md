title: First week "in" Object Oriented Programming

### What did I do this past week?

Unfortunately, I was not in class for the first week as I was in Boston wrapping up my last week at my internship with Cisco. I actually got to meet Richard Stallman while touring the Stata center at MIT and got to make a contribution to the FSF, which was an unexpected and awesome experience. It was very bittersweet leaving though, since I absolutely enjoyed my internship and would've loved to stay but I was also excited to get back and get my OOP on. I've have actually been following the class in spirit, and it seems like I was already doing similar things at my internship in respect to what was discussed in the first week of class. The difference was the tools I was using was Java oriented instead of C++. We had used TestNG as our testing framework, Gradle JaCoCo as our code coverage, and Jenkins CI for the automated build and testing.

### What's in my way?

The biggest concern I have right now is the problem of getting ramped up and up to speed on everything that was covered in class. Missing two days of class has actually put me behind quite a bit and I need to make sure I'll able to follow along in class tomorrow. Other than that though there's not much holding me back but since I don't know entirely what was covered in class, I don't exactly know what's blocking me either.

### What will I do next week?

Next week I just plan to get caught up with everything I've missed not just in this class, but in all of my other classes too. I haven't really gotten back into the study mode for classes either so that's probably something I'll need to do as well. I actually only just got back in Austin yesterday so I kind of need to get moved in which is not a trivial task. I'll try to customize my jekyll blog page to make it a little more personal too if I have any free time.

### Tip of the week

I recently started looking back into the OpenCV library for C++. It is an open source computer vision and machine learning library. It is a very well optimized and extensive library for computer vision applications that can perform a myriad of different processing operations such as facial recognition, object tracking, and retina tracking. It is a very widely used library since it's powerful and performant. I recently used it before for a research class my first year and found it incredibly useful but also pretty difficult to use. Now that I'm taking this class and can learn C++ at a much more advanced level I hope to be able to use it more effectively. For anyone who is interested in computer vision or machine learning I would highly recommend looking into the OpenCV library.
